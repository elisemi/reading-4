        <p> <br><br>The internet is like rhizomes. The internet known also as “the web” is more similar to rhizomes <br> than a web. Rhizomes are stems that shoot into the ground and continuously grow roots under- <br> ground that shoot out horizontally.
            Ginger is one example of a rhizome. Spider webs connect to <br> each other and are consistent throughout. Rhizomes are uncontrollable and unconnected even though they might overlap. This describes the internet because the internet is much
            less ordered <br> and not everything is connected to each other. The internet is also unpredictable. A rhizome is also <br> a concept in philosophy developed by philosophers Deleuze and Guattari. It describes the idea <br> that existence does
            not come from one central point. This can also be applied to the internet. </div>
